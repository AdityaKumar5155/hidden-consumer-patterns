## Coding Style

* **Linting:** Adhere to `PEP 8` standards, Python's official style guide. Use `pylint` to check the code for PEP 8 compliance.
* **Formatting:** Use `black` for code formatting.
* **Variable Naming:** Stick to `snake_case` for variable and function names, `PascalCase` for class names, and `lowercase with underscores` for file names.

Additionally, for Jupyter Notebooks specifically:

* **Cell Organization:** Group related code together in cells and use markdown cells to explain the logic and flow of your notebook.
* **Comments and Docstrings:** Write clear comments and docstrings for functions and classes to document their purpose and usage.
<!-- * **Version Control:** Use tools like `nbdime` to simplify version control for notebooks. -->
